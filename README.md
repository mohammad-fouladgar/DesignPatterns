# Design Patterns in PHP 
TDD code for design patterns by phpunit test

### Install dependencies

```bash
$ composer install
```

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install -g gulp
```

### Running Test

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Watching Unit Test For Changes

The ``gulp`` command will continue running in your terminal and watch all relevant files for changes. gulp will then automatically recompile your tests and src when it detects a change:

```bash
$ gulp
```
