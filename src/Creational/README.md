## Creational patterns

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.



* **Abstract Factory**
Creates an instance of several families of classes
* **Builder**
Separates object construction from its representation
* **Factory Method**
Creates an instance of several derived classes
* **Singleton**
A class of which only a single instance can exist
